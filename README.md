## Features


1. **Task Input**: This feature allows users to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.

2. **View Tasks**: This feature displays all added tasks in a list format. Each task is displayed with a delete button next to it.

3. **Add Task**: This feature enables users to add new tasks to the list. The new task gets appended to the existing list of tasks.

4. **Delete Task**: This feature allows users to delete a task. Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.

5. **Task Prioritization**: This feature is planned but not yet implemented. It will allow users to set priorities for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and display them accordingly.

6. **Persistent Storage**: This feature is also planned but not yet implemented. It will use local storage or session storage to save tasks and authentication status, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.
